# API-Task-Board

## Description
Having a task board has made completing tasks much more effectively and timely. This application is intended to be used amongst a team to complete their projects and manage their time wisely. The team is able to add various tasks, along with their due dates and a short description of what needs to be completed. The team members are able to see what they need to complete, which tasks are in progress, and which tasks are completed. This project has helped me better understand API's and how to use JQueries correctly.

## Installation
I was given a starter code that provided instructions on what functions I needed to use in Javascript, in order to make the task board function properly. We were also instructed to download Day.js, so that a calendar could appear when the user wants to add a deadline date. 

## Usage
If the team members are looking to use the task board, they will be taken to a page that has an "Add Task" button and three columns titled: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Once the user has clicked the "Add Task" button, they will be prompted to write the task title, a task description, and the task's due date. This task will automatically be added to the "To Do" column. If the user has already started the task or completed it, they have the option to drag the task into the appropriate column.
